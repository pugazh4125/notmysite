## First time finishing a project

**So there is a mini project contest** in my college i was in a team of 3 members but most of the work was done only by me,ok Let's get to the topic

### Choosing projects
First i decided to do a **automatic power factor correction** but i wasn't much intrested in electrical but intrested in electronics so i decided to do a **Solar Charge Controller** since my teammates didn't so any objections on switching i started doing this but i didn't got the output which made me tense and when i resting in my sofa suddenly i got this idea like *can we transmit and receive data using a solar panel* so i started doing research on this then decided to do this project ***you can find the full details about this project on my github profile link is provided at the bottom*** so then i started doing this and eventualy completed this project the day before but didn't got the output on the day of presentation,so for making up for this i did some research and learnt some things like NASA is also doing works on this project,so i included NASA and other many things to present my project but the judge didn't seem to understand whatever i said,so i guess i won't be coming in the *top 10* 

And the link for the github project is here-[my project](https://github.com/pugazh4125/laser-based-communication-using-solar/tree/main)

and i don't have much things to say,i will be starting to learn PCB designing from today and also have to focus on the college things so i guess that's it for today blog


Let's meet in the next blog,thanks for reading this..........               :)
